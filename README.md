Activeledger IDE (Codename - Active Harmony) is for developers to create and manage Activeledger smart contracts across multiple networks. This IDE helps manage the private keys for developers to sign their contracts with and the namespaces their contracts will be stored under in each specific network. This tool is currently in beta but is available for Linux, Windows and OSX.
